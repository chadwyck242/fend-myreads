# Udacity FEND MyReads (React) Project P6

The first if the React projects, but sixth project overall, of the Front End Developer NanoDegree from Udacity. Completed as part of the Grow with Google Scholarship program of which I am a student.

## Getting Started

This project is simple to run on your local machine, as all that is needed is NodeJS and the cloned project repository.


### Prerequisites

* NodeJS
* npm
* Create-React-App if you want to try building from scratch.


### Installing

Just follow these steps:

1. Install NodeJS [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Clone the project repository at `https://github.com/chadwyck242/fend-myreads`
3. Navigate to the project root folder in your terminal and run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are met.
4. Run `npm start` and the project will start in your browser.

*Note: The project is built with a Udacity supplied BooksAPI that only accepts a limited number, 20 or so, search terms. Entering anything other than these search terms will result in an empty query. The search terms are located in the `SEARCH_TERMS.md` file.*

### Quick Reflection
This is the one of the final two projects for the Grow with Google Scholarship Front End Developer NanoDegree. Of all the topics so far, this has been one of the more challenging to suddenly start with as React is much different than what we have been doing up until this point. As to why the starting projects of the React NanoDegree would comprise the ending of the FEND program is a bit confusing to me, as I am sure there is plenty that could have been covered in a pure Front End education. But after trying to work through this first project with React, I plan on coming back later and trying again. Having to rush near the end of the term left little time to explore, but I have become very curious about these new ways to build applications for the Front End.
