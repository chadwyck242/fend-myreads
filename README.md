# Udacity FEND MyReads (React) Project P6

The first if the React projects, but sixth project overall, of the Front End Developer NanoDegree from Udacity. Completed as part of the Grow with Google Scholarship program of which I am a student.

## Getting Started

This project is simple to run on your local machine, as all that is needed is NodeJS and the cloned project repository.


### Prerequisites

* NodeJS
* npm
* Create React App if you want to try building from scratch.


### Installing

Just follow these steps:

1. Install NodeJS [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Clone the project repository at `https://github.com/chadwyck242/fend-myreads`
3. Navigate to the project root folder in your terminal and run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are met.
4. Run `npm start` and the project will start in your browser.

*Note: The project is built with a Udacity supplied BooksAPI that only accepts a limited number, 20 or so, search terms. Entering anything other than these search terms will result in an empty query. The search terms are located in the `SEARCH_TERMS.md` file.*
